        <p>Algebra is field of mathematics in which letters or other symbols are used to represent quantities or numbers in formulae and/or equations. Algebra allows us to represent or model situations in which one or more of the quantities are unknown or changing. It allows us to solve problems when an unknown quantity fits more comfortably inside of a problem than at the end. It also allows us to make predictions and draw conclusions about quantities that may change or vary.</p>
        <p>The subject of Algebra is typically broken into 5 sub-sections each of which we'll discuss more in depth throughout this page.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Algebra 1 or Elementary Algebra</li>
          <li>Algebra 2 or Advanced Algebra</li>
          <li>Linear or Vector Algebra</li>
          <li>Abstract Algebra</li>
          <li>Commutative Algebra</li>

       <section class="main-section" id="Algebra_1_or_Elementary_Algebra">
        <header>Algebra 1 or Elementary Algebra</header>
        <p>In arithmetic, students are used to seeing mathematical operations performed on strings of numbers (constants), which end with an unknown solution. For example: A typical problem on a worksheet might look like this: 5 + 4 =____. In this case, the unknown is the sum of 5 and 4, which would fill in the blank. Arithmetic is suitable for simple situations like, "Jane has 5 apples, Bobby has 4 apples, how many apples do they have together?" However, there are significant limitations to this type of math.</p>
        <p>Arithmetic has a really hard time solving problems in which the unknown quantity falls inside the problem. For example, "Jane has some apples, and Bobby brings some more. Together they have 9 apples." In this situation, the unknown falls inside of the equation, like this: _____ + _____ = 9. Elementary Algebra allows us to represent situations like this using variables (symbols or letters) as place-holders for unknown numbers. We might represent the example above using the following algebra:</p>
      <code> 
        x=Jane's apples;
        y=Bobby's apples;
        x+y=9;
      </code>
        <p>Elementary Algebra teaches kids how to represent situations like the one above and to solve for the unknown quantity using arithmetic and algebraic properties. Building out this foundation is an important step in building a more full understanding of the number system.</p>

        <header>Algebra 2 or Advanced Algebra</header>
        <p>As with arithmetic, Elementary Algebra has significant limitations when it comes to modeling our world. Most mathematical situations, don't have one simple numeric answer, but rather have a range of possible solutions representing a relationship that exists between multiple variable. For example, "When a cannonball is launched vertically from a 10 foot platform at a speed of 100 feet per second, what is it's vertical position at any given time?" This situation expresses a relationship between the time that has passed since the cannonball was fired and vertical position of the cannonball relative to the ground. There are two variables being acted on by several different forces at once. To understand this type of situation, we need more complex tools than Elementary Algebra provides.</p> 
          <code>
            x=vertical position (feet)
            y=time in seconds
            y=10+100x-16x^2
          </code>
          <p>These tools include (but are not limited to):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inequalities</li>
            <li>Systems of Equations or Inequalities</li>
            <li>Matrices</li>
            <li>Conic Sections</li>
            <li>Quadratics</li>
            <li>Polynomials</li>
            <li>Trigonometry</li>
            <li>Sequences and series</li>

       <section class="main-section" id="Linear_or_Vector_Algebra">
         <header>Linear or Vector Algebra</header>
         <p> Linear algebra at its most basic level deals with vectors. These are objects that have both magnitude and direction. Vectors are often understood using coordinates. For example, a car is broken down on the side of the road. 2 people are pushing the car at a certain force. The vector of the force applied to the car is the sum of the forces applied by the two people (because they're pushing in the same direction). The operation--in this case addition--can be understood as a linear transformation. Moreover, these forces can be applied in either order due to the commutative property:</p>
         <code>
           p=force 1
           q=force 2
           r=force on vehicle
           r=p+q
          </code>
         <p>Linear algebra has applications in many fields of physical science and engineering. It's main mathematical components are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>Vectors</li>
            <li>Planes</li>
            <li>Matrices</li>
            <li>Transformations</li>
            <li>Relations</li>

       <section class="main-section" id="Abstract_Algebra">
         <header>Abstract Algebra</header>
         <p>Abstract Algebra, as its title implies, is concerned with discovering and working with mathematical truths that exist within algebraic systems independent of real-world applicability. It explores number relationships and properties as if those exist unto themselves in a perfect mathematical world. The concepts of abstract algebra are listed below:
           <ol>
             <li><span>Sets</span> – Sets is defined as the collection of the objects that are determined by some specific property for a set. For example – A set of all the 2×2 matrices, the set of two-dimensional vectors present in the plane and different forms of finite groups.</li>
             <li><span>Binary Operations</span> – When the concept of addition is conceptualized, it gives the binary operations. The concept of all the binary operations will be meaningless without a set.</li>
             <li><span>Identity Element</span> – The numbers 0 and 1 are conceptualized to give the idea of an identity element for a specific operation. Here, 0 is called the identity element for the addition operation, whereas 1 is called the identity element for the multiplication operation.</li>
             <li><span>Inverse Elements</span> – The idea of Inverse elements comes up with a negative number. For addition, we write “-a” as the inverse of “a” and for the multiplication, the inverse form is written as “a-1″.</li>
             <li><span>Associativity</span> – When integers are added, there is a property known as associativity in which the grouping up of numbers added does not affect the sum. Consider an example, 
             <code>
               (3 + 2) + 4 = 3 + (2 + 4)
            </code>
               </li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Commutative_Algebra">
         <header>Commutative Algebra</header>
           <p>Commutative Algebra is an abstract field of algebra studying commutative rings and their ideals. This field of Algebra has occupied an outsized role in the advance of algebraic principles. Consider the example of a commutative ring below:</p>
           <code>
             x+y=y+x
            </code>
